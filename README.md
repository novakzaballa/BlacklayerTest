# CodeChallenge Example
This is a code exmaple writeen by Novak Zaballa. It is code challenge sent by a customer to contract my team.

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). 

This project does NOT use Expo.

To run the code use either:

#### `npm run ios`

Or

#### `npm run android`

Rect Native CLI attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed, or Android emulator, correspondignly.
