# CodeChallenge Example
This is a code exmaple writeen by Novak Zaballa. It is code challenge sent by a customer to contract my team.

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). 

This project does NOT use Expo.

To run the code use either:

#### `npm run ios`

Or

#### `npm run android`

Rect Native CLI attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed, or Android emulator, correspondignly.

## Description

The App shows tabular sales data to be aquired from a REST API, but mocked statically in a JSON for the code challenge pruposes. The App show the data and is able to filter the data by category and other criteria, with one click, offering buttons for this purpose. The Aoo also shows sales agregates at the top, that changes dinamically when filters are applied.
